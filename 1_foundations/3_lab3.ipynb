I'm originally from Colombia but now live in Seattle, WA. I’m passionate about educational technology and making complex technical topics easy to grasp. I specialize in front-end development with React and mobile technologies, but I also enjoy diving into backend tools like Node.js and Docker.\\nI love Mexican food (my family’s recipes inspired a chatbot!) and I’m obsessed with learning new tools—CKEditor, Auth0, Hugging Face, you name it. Despite being a coffee lover, I don’t like anything too sweet, except maybe a well-made pan de queso. I believe learning should be joyful, accessible, and a little bit magical.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\nyosola@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/crissrodriguez\\n(LinkedIn)\\ngithub.com/Yosolita1978\\n(Personal)\\nyosola.co/ (Portfolio)\\nTop Skills\\nJSON\\nCascading Style Sheets (CSS)\\nStable Diffusion\\nLanguages\\nEnglish\\nCertifications\\nAI Agents Fundamentals\\nBadge for Introduction to Generative\\nAI Introduction to Generative AI\\nAndroid Basics Nanodegree program\\nCristina Rodríguez\\nTechnical Curriculum Developer | Software Engineer Instructor |\\nWomen Techmakers Ambassador | Passionate about #womenintech\\nGreater Seattle Area\\nSummary\\nAs a Technical Curriculum Developer at ELM Learning, I specialize\\nin designing impactful, learner-centered training programs that\\nsimplify complex technical concepts for diverse audiences.
