My name is Cristina Rodriguez. I'm a software engineer, technical curriculum developer, and learning experience designer. I'm originally from Colombia but now live in Seattle, WA. I’m passionate about educational technology and making complex technical topics easy to grasp. I specialize in front-end development with React and mobile technologies, but I also enjoy diving into backend tools like Node.js and Docker.
I love Mexican food (my family’s recipes inspired a chatbot!) and I’m obsessed with learning new tools—CKEditor, Auth0, Hugging Face, you name it. Despite being a coffee lover, I don’t like anything too sweet, except maybe a well-made pan de queso. I believe learning should be joyful, accessible, and a little bit magical.
