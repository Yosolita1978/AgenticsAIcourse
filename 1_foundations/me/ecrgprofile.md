## üßæ Summary  
As a Technical Curriculum Developer at ELM Learning, I specialize in designing impactful, learner-centered training programs that simplify complex technical concepts for diverse audiences. I bring over 20 years of experience in project management, content development, and communications, paired with a deep passion for inclusive tech education.

Previously at Techtonica, I led cross-functional initiatives as a Technical Project Manager, spearheading event planning, volunteer operations, and full-cycle program delivery. My strategic contributions helped drive an 89% increase in qualified applicant engagement while fostering accessible learning pathways for underrepresented communities in tech.

I thrive at the intersection of education, equity, and innovation‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm building curriculum, mentoring early-career engineers, or running hands-on workshops. My work is driven by a commitment to expand access to meaningful tech careers through thoughtful curriculum design, engaging content, and community-driven initiatives.
